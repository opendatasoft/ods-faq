   * * Data

       |link_2|

     * Data is a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables.[...]While the concept of data is commonly associated with scientific research, data is collected by a huge range of organizations and institutions, ranging from businesses (e.g., sales data, revenue, profits, stock price), governments (e.g., crime rates, unemployment rates, literacy rates) and non-governmental organizations (e.g., censuses of the number of homeless people by non-profit organizations).
   * * Data Model

       |link_3|

     * A Data Model is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to properties of the real world. For instance, a data model may specify that a data element representing a car comprise a number of other elements which in turn represent the color, size and owner of the car.
   * * Data Quality

       |link_4|

     * Data quality refers to the level of quality of data. There are many definitions of data quality but data are generally considered high quality if "they are fit for their intended uses in operations, decision making and planning."
   * * Open Data

       |link_5|

     * Open data is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control. The goals of the open data movement are similar to those of other "open" movements such as open source, open hardware, open content, and open access.
   * * Query

       |link_6|

     * A web search query is a query that a user enters into a web search engine to satisfy his or her information needs. Web search queries are distinctive in that they are often plain text or hypertext with optional search-directives (such as "and"/"or" with "-" to exclude). They vary greatly from standard query languages, which are governed by strict syntax rules as command languages with keyword or positional parameters.
   * * Semantic Web

       |link_7|

     * A representation in two (or possibly three) dimensions of the semantic relationships between and among terms and the concepts they represent; (ANSI/NISO Z39.19-200x). The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries.
   * * Taxonomy

       |link_8|

     * A collection of controlled vocabulary terms organized into a hierarchical structure. 
   * * Unstructured Data

       |link_9|

     * Data that is more free-form, such as multimedia files, images, sound files, or unstructured text. Unstructured data does not necessarily follow any format or hierarchical sequence, nor does it follow any relational rules.  Unstructured data refers to masses of (usually) computerized information which do not have a data structure which is easily readable by a machine.
